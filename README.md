# cadence
CADENCE is a local multi-agent AI system that transforms Azure DevOps user stories into production-ready backend, frontend, database, and test code. Nine agents collaborate via an in-memory Bus, using local LLMs to generate, test, and refine code entirely offline, ensuring high-quality, modular, and automated software delivery.
